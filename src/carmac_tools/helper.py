    """
    Creates and configures a logger for both file and console output.

    This function initializes a logger with specified logging level and format. It configures the logger
    to output logs to both a file and the console. The file to log to is derived from the provided filename,
    with logs being overwritten each time the logger is created.

    :param filename: The filename for the log file. The logger will use this name with a ".log" extension.
    :param name: The name of the logger. This can be __name__ to use the module's name.
    :param level: The logging level to capture. Default is logging. DEBUG (10).
                  Other levels include logging.INFO (20), logging. WARNING (30),
                  logging. ERROR (40), and logging. CRITICAL (50).
    :param log_format: The format for log messages. Default format includes timestamp, logger name,
                       log level, and the log message.

    The logger is configured to:
    - Write logs to a file named after the provided filename, with a ".log" extension, overwriting existing logs.
    - Output logs to the console.
    - Apply the same logging level and format to both file and console output.

    Example Usage:
    logger = create_logger('app', 'my_logger')
    logger.info('This is an info message')

    This will log 'This is an info message' to both the 'app.log' file and the console with the specified format.

    :returns: A configured logging.Logger object ready for logging messages.
